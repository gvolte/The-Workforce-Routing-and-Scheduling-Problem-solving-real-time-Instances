Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

@article{Bertels2006,
abstract = {Home health care, i.e. visiting and nursing patients in their homes, is a growing sector in the medical service business. From a staff rostering point of view, the problem is to find a feasible working plan for all nurses that has to respect a variety of hard and soft constraints, and preferences. Additionally, home health care problems contain a routing component: A nurse must be able to visit her patients in a given roster using a car or public transport. It is desired to design rosters that consider both, the staff rostering and vehicle routing components while minimizing transportation costs and maximizing satisfaction of patients and nurses. In this paper we present the core optimization components of the PARPAP software. In the optimization kernel, a combination of linear programming, constraint programming, and (meta-)heuristics for the home health care problem is used, and we show how to apply these different heuristics efficiently to solve home health care problems. The overall concept is able to adapt to various changes in the constraint structure, thus providing the flexibility needed in a generic tool for real-world settings.},

@article{Desrosiers1995,
abstract = {Time constrained routing and scheduling problems are encountered in a variety of industrial and service sector applications, ranging from logistics and transportation systems to material handling systems in manufacturing. The traveling salesman problem with time windows has applications in single and multiple vehicle problems. The vehicle routing problem with time windows has many industrial applications including those where dock availability is a bottleneck such as for distribution centers. This chapter describes the significant advances made in time constrained routing and scheduling. In terms of solution methodology capable of solving realistic size problems, this field has seen a natural progression from ad-hoc methods to simple heuristics, to optimization-based heuristics and recently optimal algorithms. The chapter discusses fixed schedule problems and develops in detail the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition/column generation approach which will then be applied to many of the other problem types. The vehicle routing problem with time windows and several important problem variants including the multiple traveling salesman problems is explored. The chapter examines a unified framework for fleet and crew scheduling problems. {\textcopyright} 1995, Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved},

We first devise a problem-tailored heuristic that provides good feasible solutions and then we use a meta-heuristic scheme to improve the current results. The tailored heuristic makes use of sophisticated integer programming models and the corresponding sub-problems are solved using CPLEX while the meta-heuristic framework is a randomized local search algorithm.

An IP is first used to solve the subproblem which includes the full set of hard constraints and a subset of soft constrains. A basic VNS then follows as a postprocessing procedure to further improve the IP's resulting solutions. The satisfaction of the excluded constraints from the preceding IP model is the major focus of the VNS. Very promising results are reported compared with a commercial genetic algorithm and a hybrid VNS approach on real instances arising in a Dutch hospital. The comparison results demonstrate that our hybrid approach combines the advantages of both the IP and the VNS to beat other approaches in solving this type of problems. We also believe that the proposed methodology can be applied to other resource allocation problems with a large number of constraints. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The health care system in Sweden and many other countries is facing increasing costs. The major reason is the changing age distribution of the population with more elderly people in need of support. At the same time, health care systems are often very labor and staff intensive. In this paper, we focus on a staff planning problem arising in Sweden where people receive home care from the local authorities. The objective is to develop visiting schedules for care providers that incorporate some restrictions and soft objectives. Each visit has a particular task to be performed, for example: cleaning, washing, personal hygiene and/or nursing activities. Each staff member has skills and each client should, if possible, be visited by the same contact person. The operational situation is continuously changing and planning is done each day. We describe the development of a decision support system Laps Care to aid the planners. The system consists of a number of components including information data bases, maps, optimization routines, and report possibilities. We formulate the problem using a set partitioning model and, for a solution method, we make use of a repeated matching algorithm. The system is currently in operation at a number of home care organizations. We report on the practical impact of the system in the health care organization which was involved in the development. The savings are considerably in terms of saved planning time and in the quality of the routes, as well as the measured quality for the clients. Numerical experiments of the system are presented. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model for the daily planning of health care services carried out at patients' homes by staff members of a home care company. The planning takes into account individual service requirements of the patients, individual qualifications of the staff and possible interdependencies between different service operations. Interdependencies of services can include, for example, a temporal separation of two services as is required if drugs have to be administered a certain time before providing a meal. Other services like handling a disabled patient may require two staff members working together at a patient's home. The time preferences of patients are included in terms of given time windows. In this paper, we propose a planning approach for the described problem, which can be used for optimizing economical and service oriented measures of performance. A mathematical model formulation is proposed together with a powerful heuristic based on a sophisticated solution representation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) approach based on constraint programming to solve cumulative scheduling problems. It extends earlier work on constraint-based randomized LNS for disjunctive scheduling as reported in (Nuijten {\&} Le Pape 1998). A breakthrough development in generalizing that approach toward cumulative scheduling lies in the presented way of calculating a partial-order schedule from a fixed start time schedule. The approach is applied and tested on the Cumulative Job Shop Scheduling Problem (CJSSP). An empirical performance analysis is performed using a well-known set of benchmark instances. The described approach obtains the best known performance reported to date on the CJSSP. It not only finds better solutions than ever reported before for 33 out of 36 open instances, it also proves to be very robust on the complete set of test instances. Furthermore, among these 36 open instances, one is now closed. As the approach is generic, it can be applied to other types of scheduling problems, for example problems including resource types like reservoirs and state resources, and objectives like earliness/tardiness costs and resource allocation costs.},

Tackling this type of problem often requires handling a consider-able number of requirements, including customers and workers preferences while minimising both operational costs and travelling distance. This study seeks to determine effective combinations of genetic operators com-bined with heuristics that help to find good solutions for this constrained combinatorial optimisation problem. In particular, it aims to identify the best set of operators that help to maximise customers and workers pref-erences satisfaction. This paper advances the understanding of how to effectively employ different operators within two variants of genetic algorithms to tackle WSRPs. To tackle infeasibility, an initialisation heuristic is used to generate a conflict-free initial plan and a repair heuristic is used to ensure the satisfaction of con-straints. Experiments are conducted using three sets of real-world Home Health Care (HHC) planning problem instances.},

abstract = {We present a greedy heuristic (GHI) designed to tackle five time-dependent activities constraints (synchroni- sation, overlap, minimum difference, maximum difference and minimum-maximum difference) on workforce scheduling and routing problems. These types of constraints are important because they allow the modelling of situations in which activities relate to each other time-wise, e.g. synchronising two technicians to complete a job. These constraints often make the scheduling and routing of employees more difficult. GHI is tested on set of benchmark instances from different workforce scheduling and routing problems (WSRPs). We compare the results obtained by GHI against the results from a mathematical programming solver. The comparison seeks to determine which solution method achieves more best solutions across all instances. Two parameters of GHI are discussed, the sorting of employees and the sorting of visits. We conclude that using the solver is adequate for instances with less than 100 visits but for larger instances GHI obtains better results in less time.},

Here, the requirements are merely the presence of a set of technicians that possess the necessary capabilities. An additional complication is that a set of combined technicians stays together for the duration of a work day. This typically applies to scheduling of maintenance and installation operations. We build schedules by repeated application of a flexible matching model that selects tasks to be processed and forms groups of technicians assigned to combinations of tasks. The underlying mixed integer programming (MIP) model is capable of revising technician-task allocations and performs very well, especially in the case of rare skills. The Author(s) 2011.},

The integration of scheduling workers to perform tasks with the traditional vehicle routing problem gives rise to the workforce scheduling and routing problems (WSRP). In the WSRP, a number of service technicians with different skills, and tasks at different locations with pre-defined time windows and skill requirements are given. It is required to find an assignment and ordering of technicians to tasks, where each task is performed within its time window by a technician with the required skill, for which the total cost of the routing is minimized. This paper describes an iterated local search (ILS) algorithm for the WSRP. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark instances against an off-the-shelf optimizer and an existing adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm. The proposed ILS algorithm is also applied to solve the skill vehicle routing problem, which can be viewed as a special case of the WSRP. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm can produce high-quality solutions in short computation times.},

We have a single server that can move on the arcs of the graph, at unit speed, and that has to execute all of the jobs within their respective time windows. We consider the following two problems: (a) minimize the time by which all jobs are executed (traveling salesman problem) and (b) minimize the sum of the waiting times of the jobs (traveling repairman problem). We focus on the following two special cases: (a) The jobs are located on a line and (b) the number of nodes of the graph is bounded by some integer constant B. Furthermore, we consider in detail the special cases where (a) all of the processing times are 0, (b) all of the release times ri are 0, and (c) all of the deadlines di are infinite. For many of the resulting problem combinations, we settle their complexity either by establishing NP-completeness or by presenting polynomial (or pseudopolynomial) time algorithms. Finally, we derive algorithms for the case where, for any time t, the number of jobs that can be executed at that time is bounded.},

It can model a variety of real world applications in location, allocation, machine assignment, and supply chains. The problem has been studied since the late 1960s, and computer codes for practical applications emerged in the early 1970s. We propose a new algorithm for this problem that proves to be more effective than previously existing methods. The algorithm features a path relinking approach, which is a mechanism for generating new solutions by combining two or more reference solutions. It also features an ejection chain approach, which is embedded in a neighborhood construction to create more complex and powerful moves. Computational comparisons on benchmark instances show that the method is not only effective in general, but is especially effective for types D and E instances, which are known to be very difficult. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.
