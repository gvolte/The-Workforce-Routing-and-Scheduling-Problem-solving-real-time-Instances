\chapter{  État de l'art \label{Chap:SOA}}

Dans le Chapitre \ref{Chap:SOA} nous présentons les différentes caractéristiques de notre problème, étudions la classe de problème auquel il appartient et par la même occasion nous définissons sa complexité. Dans le même temps nous étudions les applications actuelles liées aux problèmes de la classe pour déterminer les limites de ces problèmes par rapport aux données réelles. Notre problème appartient à la classe des problèmes d'ordonnancement et de routage d'employés (\textit{Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problem} en anglais, noté $\wsrp$).
